   * The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice.
   * This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response.
   * For example, if a request to send event does not respond due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that no more than one event is sent.
   * An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request.
   * How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.
   * Idempotency keys can be up to 255 characters long.
